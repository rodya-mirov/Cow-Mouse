Next Steps for Operation Cow Mouse
==================================

Roughly speaking, there are four (mostly disjoint) directions
that all need to be gone down a significant way.

Tile Engine
-----------

Obviously, I need to fix the damn jittering.  Ugh!

Town Mode
---------

2. NPCs given more to do
> 2. Eating food (and food existing)
> 3. Owning rooms instead of just piling up
> 4. Crafting (generally)?

3. NPCs given more attributes
> 1. Names, randomly generated from Markov chains, or just from a premade list
> 2. Gender
> 3. Adventurer-type attributes (health/str/etc.)
> 4. All should be displayed on follow.

Adventure Mode
--------------

1. Something about violence :)

Graphics
--------

1. 8-directional sprites, where necessary
2. More human sprite types (e.g. children, and eventually some professions with specific sprites).

World
-----

1. More interesting world, with pieces that do things

> 1. Set pieces, with value: trees, at least
> 2. Wild animals? (this might fall more under adventure mode)
> 3. Terrain features (hills, water, something)
